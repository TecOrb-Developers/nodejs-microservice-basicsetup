### Commit Message Format
Each commit message consists of a **issue**, a **type** and a **subject**.

```
[<issue>][<type>] <subject>

Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier
to read on github as well as in various git tools.

* **ADD**: Add something to code
* **FIX**: A bug fix
* **DOCS**: Documentation changes
* **UPDATE**: A update of code that is not a bug fix
* **DELETE**: Remove of file or directory
* **TEST**: Adding missing tests
* **CHORE**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation
  generation

### Subject
The subject contains succinct description of the change:

* use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
* capitalize first letter
* no dot (.) at the end
